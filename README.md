# Ancient Treasures Auction Platform

A fully-featured, front-end auction platform for ancient artifacts, built entirely with **JavaScript, HTML, and modern CSS**. This project simulates a live auction environment with a dynamic bidding system, user authentication (login/signup), and detailed item listing forms.

### Key Features:
* **Dynamic Bidding:** Place bids in real-time with UI updates.
* **User Profiles:** View bidding history and a list of won items.
* **Sell Items:** A complete form for users to list their own artifacts for auction.
* **Admin Dashboard:** A separate administrative panel to manage users (ban/delete), oversee live auctions, and view site statistics.
* **Notification System:** Alerts for being outbid, winning an auction, or selling an item.

All application data is managed entirely on the client-side using the browser's **LocalStorage**, creating a complete and self-contained web app experience without a backend.
